To run the tests, assemble and run the test runner file for a given exercise either via the MARS simulator GUI, or on the command line like so:

    java -jar /path/to/mars.jar nc runner.mips

The test runner will include your code, and either complete with a “success” message or terminate on a failing test with a message specifying the input for which that test failed.
